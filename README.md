# CarMe
This is a project developed in my free time. I've used JSP and JSTL to make the pages structure, using basically HTML with some other features given by JSP and JSTL, CSS and Javascript in the front-end, and Java servlets and a database in the back-end.
This project works like a car dealership site, without e-commerce. 

# Features
- Initial page
- Register page with CPF validation and profile picture
- Login page
- Dinamic header if the user is logged or not
