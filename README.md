# CarMe
This is a project developed in my free time. I've used JSP and JSTL to make the pages structure, using basically HTML with some other features given by JSP and JSTL, CSS and Javascript in the front-end, and Java servlets and a database in the back-end.
This project works like a car dealership site, without e-commerce. 

# Features
- Initial page
- Register page with CPF validation and profile picture
- Login page
- Dinamic header if the user is logged or not
- Catalogue page with filters and cards animation in the cars
- Page to make the annoucements. If you make an announcement, only other users will see the annoucement
- Profile page, with the options to delete the profile, delete some announcements or edit the profile information
- Page for car details, including the seller information.
- Page "About Us" <br />
# The register, login and announcement page have error information if any fields aren't filled, and CPF verifications.
